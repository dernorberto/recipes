## Ingredients

* 12 wooden skewers (place them in water to soak so they won't burn so easily)
* 4 free-range skinless chicken breasts
* 2 cloves of garlic
* 3 cm piece of ginger (also works without)
* 140 g natural yoghurt
* 60 ml passata (I made some using concentrated tomato and water)
* olive oil
* 1 teaspoon garam masala (optional)
* 1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika
* 1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric
* 1 large red pepper

## Preparation

1. Place wooden skewers in cold water to soak – this will stop them from burning
2. Peel and finely grate the garlic and ginger into a mixing bowl (garlic only also works)
3. Add: yoghurt + passata + 1 tablespoon of oil + the spices, mix well
4. Slice the chicken into bite-sized chunks + add to bowl + season with a tiny pinch of sea salt
5. Toss everything together to coat + cover with clingfilm + place in the fridge to marinate for around 2 hours
6. Halve and deseed the pepper + roughly chop into chunks roughly the same size as the chicken
7. Get the skewers + thread the ingredients between your skewers – don’t push them too close together otherwise they won’t cook properly + place onto tray
8. Put the griddle pan on a high heat to warm up (or cook them under the grill or on the barbecue - this worked really well).
9. Drizzle the skewers with a little oil + place onto griddle/under grill and cook for 10 to 15 minutes (or until cooked through), turning every 2 minutes to get nice and golden on all sides
