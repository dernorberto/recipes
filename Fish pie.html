      <li>4 spring onion, finely sliced </li>
      <li>400ml milk </li>
      <li>1 x pack fish pie mix (cod, salmon, smoked haddock etc, weight around

      <li>1 tsp Dijon or English mustard </li>
      <li>½ a 25g pack or a small bunch chives, finely snipped </li>
      <li>handful frozen sweetcorn </li>
      <li>handful frozen petits pois </li>
      <li>handful grated cheddar </li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Preparation</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 200C/ 180 fan/ gas mark 6. Put the potatoes in a
        saucepan and pour over enough water to cover them. Bring to the boil and
        then simmer until tender. When cooked, drain thoroughly and mash with a
        splash of milk and some butter. Season with ground black pepper. </li>
      <li>Meanwhile, put the butter, flour and spring onions in another pan and
        heat gently until the butter has melted, stirring regularly. Cook for 1
        -2 mins. Gradually whisk in the milk using a balloon whisk if you have
        one. Bring to the boil, stirring to avoid any lumps and sticking at the
        bottom of the pan. Cook for 3 – 4 minutes until thickened. </li>
      <li>Take off the heat and stir in the cheese (if using), fish, mustard,
        chives, sweetcorn and peas. Spoon into an ovenproof dish or 6- 8
        ramekins. </li>
      <li>Spoon the potato on top and sprinkle with cheddar cheese. Pop in the
        oven for 20 - 25 mins or until golden and bubbling at the edges.
        Alternatively, cover and freeze the pie or mini pies for another time. </li>
    </ol>
    <h1>Notes</h1>

      <li>Cooking for baby too: This fish pie can be given to your baby once
        they're weaned. Leave out the mustard and use a mix of fish that
        doesn’t include a salty smoked variety. You could use haddock and
        salmon for example. Ensure there aren’t any bones in the fish. Smoked
        fish imparts a lot of flavour so to make sure this dish is still tasty,
        stir in an extra handful of cheese once you take the sauce off the heat,
        then add the rest of the ingredients. Blend if necessary.</li>
