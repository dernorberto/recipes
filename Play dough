1 cup flour

1/4 cup salt

1 tbsp citric acid or cream of tartar

1 tbsp oil

food colouring (amount depends on the brand of colouring you are using)

1tsp orange extract (totally optional, adds nice smell)

3/4cup boiling water

1 cup = 240g

1. Combine flour, salt, citric acid, oil and orange extract (if using) in the large jug or bowl. 2. Mix food colouring with boiling water and pour it over the flour mixture. Mix it with the spoon until you get a clean dough ball. If it is too sticky, add some flour.

3. Remove the dough from the bowl and kneed it vigorously until it becomes really smooth. I love this part of the making as the dough is still warm and nice to touch!
