<h1>Ingredients</h1>
<ul>
<li>1 cup flour
<li>1/4 cup salt
<li>1 tbsp citric acid or cream of tartar
<li>1 tbsp oil
<li>food colouring (amount depends on the brand of colouring you are using)
<li>1 tsp orange extract (totally optional, adds nice smell)
<li>3/4 cup boiling water
<li>1 cup = 240g
</ul>

<h1>Preparation</h1>
<ol>
<li>Combine flour, salt, citric acid, oil and orange extract (if using) in the large jug or bowl. 
<li>Mix food colouring with boiling water and pour it over the flour mixture. Mix it with the spoon until you get a clean dough ball. If it is too sticky, add some flour.
<li>Remove the dough from the bowl and kneed it vigorously until it becomes really smooth. I love this part of the making as the dough is still warm and nice to touch!
